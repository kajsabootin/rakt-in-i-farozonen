  <h1>Scrummaster</h1>
  <p>Have you read the book scrummaster? Me neither.
  Maybe we should do that, but there is a lot of things that we should. So I think that we skip the book.</p>
  <p>We do it my way instead. In short, scrum is a method for system development.
  Scrum has been around since 1990. And it is used all over the world. Why? Scrum offers a reduced risk of failure at the end result.</p>
  <p>Which type of roles belongs in a scrum-team? The development team, scrum master and the product owner.</p>
  <p>The components included are product backlog, sprint backlog, increment, sprint, daily scrum, sprint review, sprint retrospective and the last one sprint planning.</p>
